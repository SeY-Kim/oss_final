## What does this project do?
What should I wear today? is a web service that recommends users to wear clothes suitable for today's weather and weather depending on the city.

1. Today's weather depends on the city.
2. Recommend clothes for today's weather

If you search for a city you are curious about in English, it tells you the temperature, wind speed, and humidity there.
This service recommends clothes suitable for the weather.

## Why is this project useful?
I usually like to wear clothes, but I always check the weather when I think about what to wear today.
So I made this web service because I wanted to make it useful for other people to think about what to wear.

It's useful for people who are worried about how to dress in the weather that keeps changing in a week.
